# AI-Driven-Threat-Detection-System

Project Explained

    Data Simulation:
        Simulates network traffic data with normal and anomalous behavior. Anomalous data is further categorized into specific threat types (DDoS, SQL Injection, Malware).

    Feature Extraction:
        Extracts features like packet size, duration, and requests from the network data and scales them for model training.

    Anomaly Detection Model:
        Trains an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in the network traffic.

    Threat Classification:
        Uses a RandomForestClassifier to classify detected anomalies into specific threat types.

    Automation:
        Implements an automated threat detection system that continuously monitors incoming network traffic, detects anomalies, and categorizes them as specific threats.

    Reporting:
        Generates and prints a report summarizing the detected threats, including details about the network traffic that triggered the alerts.

Important Features

    Machine Learning: Demonstrates expertise in both unsupervised (anomaly detection) and supervised (classification) learning.
    Cybersecurity Analytics: Focuses on detecting and categorizing network-based threats.
    Anomaly Detection: Uses Isolation Forest, a robust method for anomaly detection.
    Automation: The system continuously monitors network traffic and automatically detects and reports potential threats.
